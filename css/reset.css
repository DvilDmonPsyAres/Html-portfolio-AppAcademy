/* This CSS reset is a commonly used one and sets various elements to have no margin, padding, or borders, ensuring a consistent starting point for your styles across different browsers. However, it's worth noting that you can customize your reset to suit your specific needs and preferences.

Additionally, some developers prefer to use a more comprehensive CSS normalization library like Normalize.css (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) or a CSS framework like Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) or Foundation (https://foundation.zurb.com/) that includes reset styles along with other useful CSS utilities. Using such libraries can save you time and provide a more comprehensive baseline for your project. */
